# Sentry MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Sentry. This MCP server provides tools to interact with the Sentry API, allowing AI assistants to retrieve and analyze error data, manage projects, and monitor application performance.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Sentry account with API access
- Sentry authentication token with appropriate permissions

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Set the Sentry authentication token as an environment variable:
   ```
   export SENTRY_AUTH=your_sentry_auth_token
   ```

## Using this within an IDE 

This MCP has been verified to work against Codeium Windsurf.

Cursor is currently having issues with its MCP implementation; and this tool is not yet fully functional.

## Using with Claude

To use this MCP server with Claude, add the following configuration to your Claude settings:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "sentry": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["ts-node", "/Users/codydearkland/mcp-sentry-ts/index.ts"],
            "env": {
                "SENTRY_DSN": "https://0c9f30459fd17d41a01c6476a20c1d31@o4508130833793024.ingest.us.sentry.io/4508879435071488",
                "SENTRY_AUTH": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` with your Sentry authentication token.
